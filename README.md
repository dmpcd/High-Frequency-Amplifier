# High Frequency Amplifier Project

## Introduction

This project involves the design and development of a high-frequency amplifier capable of driving an 8-ohm speaker without distortion. The amplifier operates within a frequency range of 20kHz to 100kHz and is composed of a two-stage design: a common emitter pre-amplifier for voltage amplification and a class AB power amplifier with voltage buffers for power amplification.

## Features

- **Frequency Range**: 20kHz to 100kHz
- **Load**: Drives an 8-ohm speaker without significant distortion
- **Stages**: Two-stage amplifier design
  - **Pre-Amplifier**: Common emitter configuration for voltage amplification
  - **Power Amplifier**: Class AB with voltage buffers for power amplification
- **Gain**: Open terminal voltage gain of 28.5 (theoretical), with a practical gain of 18.1 when driving a speaker
- **Efficiency**: Designed to minimize power dissipation while ensuring high performance

## Design Approach

The design of the amplifier involved several steps:

1. **Class A Amplifier Stage**: Provides full amplification of the input signal with a simple structure but is inefficient due to constant current flow.
2. **Class B Amplifier Stage**: Conducts only half of the input signal and uses a push-pull arrangement to combine outputs, reducing power loss but introducing zero crossing distortion.
3. **Class AB Amplifier Stage**: Combines the benefits of Class A and Class B stages to minimize distortion while maintaining efficiency.
4. **Voltage Buffer Stage**: Incorporates voltage buffers using the common collector configuration to isolate transistors and achieve high gain.
